I want to participate in the Discrete Maths for Computer Science program because 
I want to learn & use different mathematical tools while developing and analyzing algorithms. 
I've always been interested on Discrete mathematics and used number 
theory and other aspects of Discrete mathematics while developing algorithms for various problems.
